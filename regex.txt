:::You could use the regular expression \b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,}\b to search for an email address. Any email address, to be exact. A very similar regular expression (replace the first \b with ^ and the last one with $) can be used by a programmer to check whether the user entered a properly formatted email address. In just one line of code, whether that code is written in Perl, PHP, Java, a .NET language, or a multitude of other languages.


:::Twelve characters have special meanings in regular expressions: the backslash \, the caret ^, the dollar sign $, the period or dot ., the vertical bar or pipe symbol |, the question mark ?, the asterisk or star *, the plus sign +, the opening parenthesis (, the closing parenthesis ), the opening square bracket [, and the opening curly brace {. These special characters are often called “metacharacters”. Most of them are errors when used alone.

If you want to use any of these characters as a literal in a regex, you need to escape them with a backslash. If you want to match 1+1=2, the correct regex is 1\+1=2. Otherwise, the plus sign has a special meaning.
:::Character Classes or Character Sets
A “character class” matches only one out of several characters. To match an a or an e, use [ae]. You could use this in gr[ae]y to match either gray or grey. A character class matches only a single character. gr[ae]y does not match graay, graey or any such thing. The order of the characters inside a character class does not matter. Typing a caret after the opening square bracket negates the character class. The result is that the character class matches any character that is not in the character class. q[^x] matches qu in question. It does not match Iraq since there is no character after the q for the negated character class to match.The character class [^x] is looking for a character that is not 'x' immediately after 'q', but in the word "Iraq", there is no character after 'q' to fulfill this condition.

:::Shorthand Character Classes
\d matches a single character that is a digit, \w matches a “word character” (alphanumeric characters plus underscore), and \s matches a whitespace character (includes tabs and line breaks). The actual characters matched by the shorthands depends on the software you’re using. In modern applications, they include non-English letters and numbers.

:::The Dot Matches (Almost) Any Character
The dot matches a single character, except line break characters. Most applications have a “dot matches all” or “single line” mode that makes the dot match any single character, including line breaks. gr.y matches gray, grey, gr%y, etc. Use the dot sparingly. Often, a character class or negated character class is faster and more precise.

:::Anchors
Anchors do not match any characters. They match a position. ^ matches at the start of the string, and $ matches at the end of the string. Most regex engines have a “multi-line” mode that makes ^ match after any line break, and $ before any line break. E.g. ^b matches only the first b in bob. \b matches at a word boundary. A word boundary is a position between a character that can be matched by \w and a character that cannot be matched by \w. \b also matches at the start and/or end of the string if the first and/or last characters in the string are word characters. \B matches at every position where \b cannot match.

:::Alternation
Alternation is the regular expression equivalent of “or”. cat|dog matches cat in About cats and dogs. If the regex is applied again, it matches dog. You can add as many alternatives as you want: cat|dog|mouse|fish. Alternation has the lowest precedence of all regex operators. cat|dog food matches cat or dog food. To create a regex that matches cat food or dog food, you need to group the alternatives: (cat|dog) food.

:::Repetition
The question mark makes the preceding token in the regular expression optional. colou?r matches colour or color.
The asterisk or star tells the engine to attempt to match the preceding token zero or more times. The plus tells the engine to attempt to match the preceding token once or more. <[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]*> matches an HTML tag without any attributes. <[A-Za-z0-9]+> is easier to write but matches invalid tags such as <1>.
Use curly braces to specify a specific amount of repetition. Use \b[1-9][0-9]{3}\b to match a number between 1000 and 9999. \b[1-9][0-9]{2,4}\b matches a number between 100 and 99999.
Let's break down the examples you provided:
 <[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]*>: This regular expression matches an HTML tag without any attributes. It expects a single alphabetic character (case-insensitive) followed by    zero or more alphanumeric characters. This pattern would match valid tags like <p>, <div>, or <h1>, but it would not match tags with attributes like <a href="#">.
 <[A-Za-z0-9]+>: This regular expression also matches an HTML tag, but it allows for any combination of one or more alphabetic or numeric characters. While it is    easier to write, it may match invalid tags like <1>, which is not a valid HTML tag.
 \b[1-9][0-9]{3}\b: This regular expression matches a number between 1000 and 9999. It expects a non-zero digit followed by three digits. The \b symbols denote word    boundaries, ensuring that the number is not part of a larger word. For example, it would match '1000', '2345', and '9999', but not '123' or '10000'.
 \b[1-9][0-9]{2,4}\b: This regular expression matches a number between 100 and 99999. It expects a non-zero digit followed by two to four digits. Again, the \b symbols    ensure word boundaries. This pattern would match numbers like '123', '5678', '999', '10000', and '99999'.

:::Greedy and Lazy Repetition
The repetition operators or quantifiers are greedy. They expand the match as far as they can, and only give back if they must to satisfy the remainder of the regex. The regex <.+> matches <EM>first</EM> in This is a <EM>first</EM> test.
Place a question mark after the quantifier to make it lazy. <.+?> matches <EM> in the above string.
A better solution is to follow my advice to use the dot sparingly. Use <[^<>]+> to quickly match an HTML tag without regard to attributes. The negated character class is more specific than the dot, which helps the regex engine find matches quickly

:::Backreferences
Within the regular expression, you can use the backreference \1 to match the same text that was matched by the capturing group. ([abc])=\1 matches a=a, b=b, and c=c. It does not match anything else. If your regex has multiple capturing groups, they are numbered counting their opening parentheses from left to right.Let's consider an example pattern: ([A-Za-z]+)=(\d+)-\2
In this pattern, there are two capturing groups defined ([A-Za-z]+): This captures one or more alphabetic characters.
(\d+): This captures one or more digits.
The backreference \2 is used in the pattern to refer back to the second capturing group, (\d+). This means that the text matched by the second capturing group must be repeated in the same position within the pattern.
For example, let's examine the input "OpenAI=123-123". Here's how the pattern matches:
([A-Za-z]+) captures "OpenAI" and is stored as the first capturing group.
"=" matches the equal sign literally.
(\d+) captures "123" and is stored as the second capturing group.
"-" matches the hyphen literally.
\2 refers back to the second capturing group, which contains "123", so it matches "123" in the same position.
Therefore, this pattern will match "OpenAI=123-123" because the text captured by the second capturing group is repeated correctly using the backreference \2.
To summarize, the backreference \2 (or higher numbers) is used in a regular expression when there are multiple capturing groups, and it refers back to the text matched by the corresponding capturing group in the same position within the pattern.

:::Unicode Properties
\p{L} matches a single character that is in the given Unicode category. L stands for letter. \P{L} matches a single character that is not in the given Unicode category. 

:::Lookaround in regular expressions is a mechanism that allows you to match a specific position in the text without including the actual matched characters in the overall match. Lookaround constructs are considered zero-width assertions because they don't consume any characters during the matching process.
There are two types of lookaround:
Lookahead:
Positive Lookahead: It is denoted by (?=...) and asserts that a specific pattern (represented by ...) must be present ahead (to the right) of the current position in the text.
Example: q(?=u) matches the "q" in "question" but not in "Iraq". It ensures that the "q" is followed by a "u", but the "u" itself is not considered part of the overall match. The lookahead is performed at each position in the string before a "u".
Negative Lookahead: It is denoted by (?!...) and asserts that a specific pattern (represented by ...) must not be present ahead (to the right) of the current position in the text.
Example: q(?!u) matches the "q" in "Iraq" but not in "question". It ensures that the "q" is not followed by a "u". The lookahead is performed at each position, and if the specified pattern is found, the match is discarded.
Lookbehind:
Positive Lookbehind: It is denoted by (?<=...) and asserts that a specific pattern (represented by ...) must be present behind (to the left) of the current position in the text.
Example: (?<=a)b matches the "b" in "abc". It ensures that the "b" is preceded by an "a". The lookbehind mechanism checks the presence of "a" behind the current position, and if it is found, the "b" is considered a match.
Negative Lookbehind: It is denoted by (?<!...) and asserts that a specific pattern (represented by ...) must not be present behind (to the left) of the current position in the text.
Example: (?<!a)b fails to match the "b" in "abc". It ensures that the "b" is not preceded by an "a". If the specified pattern is found behind the current position, the match fails.

JAVASCRIPT REGEX
The "i" in the regular expression /w3schools/i is a flag that modifies the matching behavior of the regular expression. In this case, the "i" flag stands for "case-insensitive." When the "i" flag is applied to a regular expression, it allows for a case-insensitive match, meaning that uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as equivalent. So, in the example of /w3schools/i, it would match not only "w3schools" but also "W3SCHOOLS", "W3schools", or any other combination of letter cases.
